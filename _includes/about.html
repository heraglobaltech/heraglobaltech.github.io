          <h2>About</h2>
          <br/>
Hera Global Tech Inc. is a woman led company that addresses the issues of women's safety by its personal safety products and solutions designed with the user and community in mind. With headquarters in Pittsburgh, PA it was founded in 2017 as a response to the rise in sexual abuse and assault cases. 
<br/><br/>
The company’s first product ‘Abel’, is a unique system that consists of a wearable device and associated phone app that leverage current and emerging sensor technology. The system intuitively detects a high-risk situation based on physiological and personal responses and alerts the wearer's identified contacts or community, with their location. 

Unlike other devices which require one to press a button or make a phone call, Abel provides an instinctive reaction, while remaining inconspicuous. It is designed with the understanding that everyone is vulnerable and may not have the time to consciously react when the unexpected happens. Abel was one of the 16 semi-finalists selected for the Anu & Naveen Jain Safety XPRIZE in 2018.
<br/><br/>
Hera Global Tech’s commitment for meaningful change goes beyond finances. The company supports social organizations and efforts that address universal problems to bring about meaningful impact in the short term and long term.
